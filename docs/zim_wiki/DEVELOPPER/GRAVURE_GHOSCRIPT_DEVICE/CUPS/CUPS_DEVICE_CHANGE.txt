	CUPS Raster output device: Ignore RIP_MAX_CACHE environment variable

	Ghostscript is (at least currently) not able to work with hard-limited
	space parameters. It crashes with a segmentation fault on many input
	files then. Leaving the setting of these parameters fully automatic
	Ghostscript works just fine. As in most distributions (Currently all
	except Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives) CUPS imposes a hard
	limit via the RIP_MAX_CACHE environment variable, the only way to
	assure reliable working of Ghostscript is to ignore the parameter,
	leaving the space parameters in automatic mode. For CUPS this should
	be no regression, as print queues with other Ghostscript drivers (like
	pxlcolor, ljet4, ...) worked without hard limits all the time and no
	one complained.

	To ignore this RIP_MAX_CACHE we simply add a "return" right at the
	beginning of this function. It will be removed when a real fix gets
	into place.

	See http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691586

	Added "-dNOINTERPOLATE" to the Ghostscript command lines of the CUPS filters

	This makes rendering significantly faster and the output of normal
	files comming as print jobs from applications does not show any
	visible difference.
