====== THRESHOLD ARRAY GENERATOR ======
Created mercredi 19 novembre 2014

=== FEATURES ===

* produce irrational angle
* parametric precision for requested angle
* handle production of halfone sets
* stable and consistant lineature between different angle from a set
* control of rosette patern
* 16 bit threshold array
* usage of supercell to produce 12bit halftone depth
* export in postscript ready to use with ghostscript
* incorporate inkjet dot overlap model for minimizing dot gain
* for screenprinting, predict and avoid frequency that will cause moire
   between halftone and screen mesh
* parametric minimum dot size
