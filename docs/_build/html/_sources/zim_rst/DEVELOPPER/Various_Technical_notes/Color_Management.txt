| So, if you have a new media you want the printer to advertise, you use Set-Printer-Attributes to register it with the printer, just like for profiles.

| AFAIK the only filter which does thid under Linux is gstoraster, a 
| Ghostscript-based filter which turns PDF or PostScript into CUPS Raster. 
| The filter is part of the Ghostscript package and to actually use it it 
| must be taken care that its cost factors in the MIME conversion rules 
| are lower than the factors of pdftoraster (Poppler-based filter). 
| gstoraster reads out the *cupsiccprofile keywords in the PPD and makes 
| Ghostscript applying the appropriate ICC profile if the profile is 
| actually installed.

| This naturally works only for CUPS-Rster based drivers, not for native 
| PostScript printers or for foomatic-rip-based drivers for example.

| [Openicc] Gutenprint mission ... Printer profiling workflow

| Hello to all, some feedback from a non-developer:


| The color transformation from the document space to printer colorspace 
| can be done in several places:
| - local application like e.g. gimp, scribus or other
| - CUPS filter like e.g. GhostScript, Poppler
| - Printer Driver like e.g. Turoprint

| For working with printer profiles, it is necessary, that the whole chain 
| application->CUPS-Filter->Driver is transparent to the enduser, and that 
| the enduser can be shure, that there is no double or triple 
| transformation of print data in the chain. Reaching such transparency is 
| a very challinging tasks, which has not been solved till today in Mac OS 
| X or Windows environments incl. Adobe applications and drivers of the 
| main printer vendor.

| Typical tasks for endusers are:
| 1) decide, where the printer profile should be used (application, 
| CUPS/Filter, Driver)
| 2) Configure the chain, to avoid double or triple color transformations
| 3) create or choose a printing queue / driver setting which relates to 
| the printer profile
| 	 3a. Install a standard printer profile for this queue / setting 
| (This could be also a printer profile which have embedded driver settings)
| 	 3b. Optionally print a testchart  for profiling

|  From my experience of making printer profiles since 15 years, it makes 
| a lot of sense, that the tasks of:
| - choosing the driver setting (optional with calibration / setup of inkl 
| limits, ...)
| - printing the testchart
| - measuring the testchart and calculating the printer profile
| - connecting the printer profile and the driver settings

| are done in very controlled environment. If possible I would prefer a 
| solution which by passes CUPS and any filters and sends the testchart 
| for profiling as bitmap data direct to the printer driver (e.g. 
| Gutenprint).
| (For shure it helps very much, if we have optional a controlled way to 
| send profiling testcharts through the CUPS / Filter chain. If this is 
| the case, I would recommend, that the printed testchart has an 
| additional control slug / text line, which documents the color settings 
| of the CUPS queue and all involved filters)

| In a LINUX environment with ArgyllCMS and Gutenprint, I would prefer a 
| special application, which guides the user through the differnt steps 
| for profiling the printer and which has a direct connection to ArgyllCMS 
| and Gutenprint.

| A basic scenario for a first version of such applicazion could be:
| - Choose a predefined Gutenprint setup (creating such setups and 
| calibration is a task for a future version)
| - Choose your measurement instrument
| - Choose the testchart
| - Send the testchart as bitmap directly to Gutenprint
| - Measure the testchart
| - Calculate the printer profile automatically with ArgyllCMS
| - Embedd the Gutenprint Settings as Metadata into the printer profile

| Perfect would be, when the printer profile would be automatically 
| configured in the printing enviroment. But this tasl is very dependend 
| from the choosen printing environment. If Oyranos or colord is part of 
| the printing enviroment and connected to the profiling application, the 
| automatic configuration of the printer profile should be possible.


| Best regards
