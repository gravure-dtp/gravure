cups is in severe need for a dedicated Debian maintainer.

Set "FileDevice Yes" in cupsd.conf (see man
cupsd.conf), and as a device name use something like
[file:///tmp/cups.out](../../../../../../../../tmp/cups.out); I haven't tried that for a while, but back then
it worked fine. For postscript output you can of course use the result
right away. For raster data there's a nice viewer out there [1], but
it's not packaged.
